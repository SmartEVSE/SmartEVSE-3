# How to configure
* First configure all settings that are shown to you (see below); don't configure your MAINSMET
* Now you are ready to test/operate your SmartEVSE in its simplest mode, called Normal Mode.
* If your EV charges at MAX current, and everything works as expected, and you don't have a MAINSMET, you are done!
* If you have a MAINSMET, configure it now; browse through the settings again, since now other options have opened up
* If you are feeding your SmartEVSE with MAINS or EV data through the REST API or the MQTT API, make sure you have set up these feeds; as soon as you select "API" for the Meters, the data is expected within 11 seconds! You can use the test scripts in the test directory to feed your MQTT server with test data.
* If you configured MULTIple SmartEVSE's, follow instructions below
* Put your SmartEVSE in Solar Mode, and some specific settings for Solar Mode will open up
* Now your SmartEVSE is ready for use!

# All menu options on the LCD screen:
```
MODE:
        Per default you are in Normal EVSE mode; you can also choose Smart Mode or Solar Mode,
        but you will have to configure a MAINSMETer to actually use these modes. 
  <Normal>	The EV will charge with the current set at MAX
  <Smart>	The EV will charge with a dynamic charge current, depending on MAINSMET
                data, and MAINS, MAX, MIN settings
  <Solar>       The EV will charge on solar power

CONFIG  Configure EVSE with Type 2 Socket or fixed cable:
  <Socket>      Your SmartEVSE is connected to a socket, so it will need to sense the
                cable used for its maximum capacity
  <Fixed>       Your SmartEVSE is connected to a fixed cable, so MAX will determine your
                maximum charge current

LOCK    (only appears when CONFIG is set to <Socket>)
        Enable or disable the locking actuator (config = socket)
  <Disabled>    No lock is used
  <Solenoid>	Dostar, DUOSIDA DSIEC-ELB or Ratio lock
  <Motor>	Signal wire reversed, DUOSIDA DSIEC-EL or Phoenix Contact

PWR SHARE  ; formerly known as LOADBALANCING.
        2 to 8 EVSE’s can be connected via modbus, and their load will be balanced
  <Disabled>	Single SmartEVSE
  <Master>	Set the first SmartEVSE to Master. Make sure there is only one Master.
  <Node1-7>	And the other SmartEVSE's to Node 1-7.

MAINSMET Set type of MAINS meter (only appears in Smart or Solar mode):
  <Disabled>    No MAINS meter connected; only Normal mode possible
  <Sensorbox>   the Sensorbox will send measurement data to the SmartEVSE
  <API>         The MAINS meter data will be fed through the REST API or the MQTT API.
  <Phoenix C> / <Finder> / <...> / <Custom> a Modbus kWh meter is used

  Note that Eastron1P is for single phase Eastron meters, Eastron3P for Eastron three phase
  meters, and InvEastron is for Eastron three phase meter that is fed from below (inverted).
  If MAINSMET is not <Disabled> and not <API>, these settings appear:
  MAINSADR  Set the Modbus address for the kWh meter
  GRID      (only appears when Sensorbox with CT’s is used)
            3 or 4 wire
  CAL	    Calibrate CT1. CT2 and CT3 will use the same cal value.
	    6.0-99.9A	A minimum of 6A is required in order to change this value.
            Hold both ▼and ▲ buttons to reset to default settings.

EV METER Set type of EV kWh meter (measures power and charged energy)
  <Disabled>  No EV meter connected.
  <API>         The EV meter data will be fed through the REST API or the MQTT API.
  <Phoenix C> / <Finder> / <...> / <Custom> a Modbus kWh meter is used

  Note that Eastron1P is for single phase Eastron meters, Eastron3P for Eastron three phase
  meters, and InvEastron is for Eastron three phase meter that is fed from below (inverted).
  If EV METER is not <Disabled> and not <API>, this setting appears:
  EV ADR   Set the Modbus address for the EV Meter

MAINS	(only appears when a MAINSMET is configured):
        Set Max Mains current: 10-200A (per phase)

MIN     (only appears when a MAINSMET is configured):
        Set MIN charge current for the EV: 6-16A (per phase)

MAX	Set MAX charge current for the EV: 10-80A (per phase)
        If CONFIG is set to <Fixed>, configure MAX lower or equal to the maximum current
        that your fixed cable can carry.

CIRCUIT	(only appears when PWR SHARE set to <Master>, or when PWR SHARE set to <Disabled>
        and Mode is Smart or Solar and EV METER not set to <Disabled>):
        Set the max current the EVSE circuit can handle (load balancing): 10-200A
        (see also subpanel wiring)

SWITCH  Set the function of an external switch connected to pin SW
  <Disabled>    A push button on io pin SW can be used to STOP charging
  <Access B>    A momentary push Button is used to enable/disable access to the charging station

RFID    use a RFID card reader to enable/disable access to the EVSE
        A maximum of 20 RFID cards can be stored.
                <Disabled> / <Enabled> / <Learn> / <Delete> / <Delete All>

WIFI          Enable wifi connection to your LAN
  <Disabled>  No wifi connection
  <SetupWifi> The SmartEVSE presents itself as a Wifi Acces Point "smartevse-xxxx";
              connect with your phone to that access point, goto http://192.168.4.1/
              and configure your Wifi password
  <Enabled>   Connect to your LAN via Wifi.

MAX TEMP      Maximum allowed temperature for your SmartEVSE; 40-75C, default 65.
              You can increase this if your SmartEVSE is in direct sunlight.

SUMMAINS      (only appears when a MAINSMET is configured):
              Maximum allowed Mains Current summed over all phases: 10-600A
              This is used for the EU Capacity rate limiting, currently only in Belgium

The following options are only shown when Mode set to <Solar> and
PWR SHARE set to <Disabled> or <Master>:
START         set the current on which the EV should start Solar charging:
              -0  -48A (sum of all phases)
STOP          Stop charging when there is not enough solar power available:
              Disabled - 60 minutes (Disabled = never stop charging)
IMPORT        Allow additional grid power when solar charging: 0-20A (summed over all phases)
              NOTE: A setting of IMPORT lower thant START + MIN makes NO SENSE and will
              result in a non-charging SmartEVSE when in Solar mode.
              You even need to set IMPORT at least a few Amps higher then START + MIN to get
              a desired charging behaviour if you are charging at 1 phase.
              You even need to set IMPORT at least a few Amps higher then START + 3 * MIN to get
              a desired charging behaviour if you are charging at 3 phases.
              NOTE2: Note that START and IMPORT are summed over all phases, and MIN is per phase!
CONTACT2      One can add a second contactor (C2) that switches off 2 of the 3 phases of a
              3 phase Mains installation; this can be useful if one wants to charge of off
              Solar; EV's have a minimal charge current of 6A, so switching off 2 phases
              allows you to charge with a current of 6-18A, while 3 phases have a
              minimum current of 3x6A=18A.
              This way you can still charge solar-only on smaller solar installations.
<br>
              IMPORTANT NOTE: You WILL have to wire your C2 contactor according to the schematics
              in [Hardware installation](docs/installation.md). If you invent your own wiring
              your installation will be UNSAFE!

  <Not present> No second contactor C2 is present (default)
  <Always Off>  C2 is always off, so you are single phase charging
  <Always On>   C2 is always on, so you are three phase charging (if your Mains are three phase and your EV
                supports it)
  <Solar Off>   C2 is always on except in Solar Mode where it is always off
  <Auto>        SmartEVSE starts charging at 3phase, but when in Solar mode and not enough
                current available for 3 phases, switches off C2 so it will continue on 1 phase

# REST API

For the specification of the REST API, see [REST API](REST_API.md)

# MQTT API
Your SmartEVSE can now export the most important data to your MQTT-server. Just fill in the configuration data on the webserver and the data will automatically be announced to your MQTT server.

You can easily show all the MQTT topics published:
```
mosquitto_sub -v -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password  -t '#'
```

You can feed the SmartEVSE data by publishing to a topic:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/CurrentOverride' -m 150
```
...where xxxxx your SmartEVSE's serial number, will set your Override Current to 15.0A.

Valid topics you can publish to are:
```
/Set/Mode
/Set/CurrentOverride
/Set/CurrentMaxSumMains
/Set/CPPWMOverride
/Set/MainsMeter
/Set/EVMeter
/Set/HomeBatteryCurrent
/Set/RequiredEVCCID
```
Your MainsMeter can be fed with:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/MainsMeter' -m L1:L2:L3
```
...where L1 - L3 are the currents in deci-Ampères. So 100 means 10.0A.

You can find test scripts in the test directory that feed EV and MainsMeter data to your MQTT server.

# Multiple SmartEVSE controllers on one mains supply (Power Share)
Up to eight SmartEVSE modules can share one mains supply.
  - Hardware connections
    - Connect the A, B and GND connections from the Master to the Node(s).
    - So A connects to A, B goes to B etc.
    - If you are using Smart/Solar mode, you should connect the A, B , +12V and GND wires from the sensorbox to the same screw terminals of the SmartEVSE! Make sure that the +12V  wire from the sensorbox is connected to only  -one– SmartEVSE.

  - Software configuration
    - Set one SmartEVSE PWR SHARE setting to MASTER, the others to NODE 1-7. Make sure there is only one Master, and the Node numbers are unique.
    - On the Master configure the following:
      - MODE	  Set this to Smart if a Sensorbox (or configured kWh meter) is used to measure the current draw on the mains supply.
      It will then dynamically vary the charge current for all connected EV’s.  If you are using a dedicated mains supply for the EV’s you can leave this set to Normal.
      - MAINS Set to the maximum current of the MAINS connection (per phase).
      If the sensorbox or other MainsMeter device measures a higher current then this value on one of the phases, it will immediately reduce the current to the EVSE’s
      - CIRCUIT Set this to the maximum current of the EVSE circuit (per phase).
      This will be split between the connected and charging EV’s.
      - MAX 		 Set the maximum charging current for the EV connected to -this- SmartEVSE (per phase).
      - MIN		 Set to the lowest allowable charging current for all connected EV’s.
    - On the Nodes configure the following:
      - MAX 		 Set the maximum charging current for the EV connected to -this- SmartEVSE (per phase).

# Home Battery Integration
In a normal EVSE setup a sensorbox is used to read the P1 information to deduce if there is sufficient solar energy available. This however can give unwanted results when also using a home battery as this will result in one battery charging the other one. <br/>

For this purpose the settings endpoint allows you to pass through the battery current information:
* A positive current means the battery is charging
* A negative current means the battery is discharging

The EVSE will use the battery current to neutralize the impact of a home battery on the P1 information.<br>
**Regular updates from the consumer are required to keep this working as values cannot be older than 11 seconds.**

### Example
* Home battery is charging at 2300W -> 10A
* P1 has an export value of 230W -> -1A
* EVSE will neutralize the battery and P1 will be "exporting" -11A

The sender has several options when sending the home battery current:
* Send the current AS-IS -> EVSE current will be maximized
* Only send when battery is discharging -> AS-IS operation but EVSE will not discharge the home battery
* Reserve an amount of current for the home battery (e.g. 10A) -> Prioritize the home battery up to a specific limit

# Integration with Home Assistant
There are three options to integrate SmartEVSE with Home Assistant:
* through the HA-integration - the easy way<br />

    If you want to integrate your SmartEVSE with Home Asisstant, please have a look at [the SmartEVSE `custom_component` for Home Assistant](https://github.com/dingo35/ha-SmartEVSEv3). This `custom_component` uses the API to share data from the SmartEVSE to Home Assistant, and enables you to set SmartEVSE settings from Home Assistant. You will need firmware version 1.5.2 or higher to use this integration.

* by manually configuring your configuration.yaml<br />

    Its a lot of work, but you can have everything exactly your way. See examples in the integrations directory of our github repository.

* by MQTT<br />

    If you don't like the integration, e.g. because it only updates its data every 60 seconds, you might like to interface through MQTT; updates are done as soon as values change.... you can even mix it up by using both the integration AND the MQTT interface at the same time!

# EU Capacity Rate Limiting
An EU directive gives electricity providers the possibility to charge end consumers by a "capacity rate", so consumers will be stimulated to flatten their usage curve.
Currently the only known country that has this active is Belgium.
For more details see https://github.com/serkri/SmartEVSE-3/issues/215

* In the Menu screen an item "SumMains" is now available, default set at 600A
* This setting will only be of use in Smart or Solar mode
* Apart from all other limits (Mains, MaxCirCuit), the charge current will be limited so that the sum of all phases of the Mains currents will not be exceeding the SumMains setting
* If you don't understand this setting, or don't live in Belgium, leave this setting at its default value

# Building the firmware
You can get the latest release off of https://github.com/dingo35/SmartEVSE-3.5/releases, but if you want to build it yourself:
* Install platformio-core https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/methods/index.html
* Clone this github project, cd to the smartevse directory where platformio.ini is located
* Compile firmware.bin: platformio run
For versions older than v3.6.0:
* Compile spiffs.bin: platformio run -t buildfs

If you are not using the webserver /update endpoint:
* Upload via USB configured in platformio.ini: platformio run --target upload
