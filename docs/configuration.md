# How to configure
* First configure all settings that are shown to you (see below); don't configure your MAINSMET
* Now you are ready to test/operate your SmartEVSE in its simplest mode, called Normal Mode.
* If your EV charges at MAX current, everything works as expected, and you don't have a MAINSMET, you are done!
* If you have a MAINSMET, configure it now; browse through the settings again, since now other options have opened up
* If you are feeding your SmartEVSE with MAINS or EV data through the REST API or the MQTT API, make sure you have set up these feeds; as soon as you select "API" for the Meters, the data is expected within 11 seconds! You can use the test scripts in the test directory to feed your MQTT server with test data.
* If you configured MULTIple SmartEVSE's, follow the instructions below
* Put your SmartEVSE in Solar Mode, and some specific settings for Solar Mode will open up
* Now your SmartEVSE is ready for use!

# All menu options on the LCD screen:
## MODE
By default, you are in normal EVSE mode. You can also choose smart mode or solar mode, but these modes require configuring a [MAINS MET](#mains_met) to function.

- **Normal**: The EV will charge with the current set at [MAX](#max).
- **Smart**: The EV will charge with a dynamic charge current, depending on [MAINSMET](#mainsmet) data, [MAINS](#mains), [MAX](#max) and [MIN](#min) settings.
- **Solar**: The EV will charge using solar power.

## CONFIG
Configure SmartEVSE with Type 2 Socket or fixed cable.

- **Socket**: The SmartEVSE is connected to a socket, so it will need to sense the cable used for its maximum capacity.

## CAP STOP
Only appears when [CAPACITY](#capacity) is configured. Timer in minutes. If CAPACITY is exceeded, charging will not immediately stop but will wait until the timer expires.  
- If set to **Disabled**, charging stops immediately when CAPACITY is exceeded.

## CONTACT2
Use a second contactor (C2) to switch phases L2 and L3. 

- **Not present**: The second contactor is not present, and SmartEVSE assumes 3-phase charging.
- **Always Off**: C2 is always off, single-phase charging.
- **Always On**: C2 is always on, three-phase charging (default).
- **Solar Off**: C2 is always on except in Solar Mode, where it is always off.
- **Auto**: SmartEVSE starts charging at 3-phase, but in Solar Mode, it will switch off C2 when there is not enough current for 3 phases, continuing on 1 phase.

**Important**: Wire your C2 contactor according to the schematics in the [Hardware installation](docs/installation.md).

# OCPP
See the OCPP section in the SmartEVSE dashboard for setting up identifiers and configuring the OCPP interface.
Connect to the OCPP server using the credentials set up in the SmartEVSE dashboard. To use
the RFID reader with OCPP, set the mode Rmt/OCPP in the RFID menu. Note that the other
RFID modes overrule the OCPP access control. OCPP SmartCharging requires the SmartEVSE
internal load balancing means to be turned off.

# REST API

For the specification of the REST API, see [REST API](REST_API.md)

# MQTT API
Your SmartEVSE can now export the most important data to your MQTT-server. Just fill in the configuration data on the webserver and the data will automatically be announced to your MQTT server. Note that because the configuration data is transported to the SmartEVSE via the URL, special characters are not allowed.

You can easily show all the MQTT topics published:
```
mosquitto_sub -v -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password  -t '#'
```

You can feed the SmartEVSE data by publishing to a topic:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/CurrentOverride' -m 150
```
...where xxxxx your SmartEVSE's serial number, will set your Override Current to 15.0A.

Valid topics you can publish to are:
```
/Set/Mode
/Set/CurrentOverride
/Set/CurrentMaxSumMains
/Set/CPPWMOverride
/Set/MainsMeter
/Set/EVMeter
/Set/HomeBatteryCurrent
/Set/RequiredEVCCID
/Set/ColorOff
/Set/ColorNormal
/Set/ColorSmart
/Set/ColorSolar
```
Your mains kWh meter data can be fed with:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/MainsMeter' -m L1:L2:L3
```
...where L1 - L3 are the currents in deci-Ampères. So 100 means 10.0A importing, -5 means 0.5A exporting.
...These should be fed at least ervery 10 seconds.

Your EV kWh meter data can be fed with:
```
mosquitto_pub  -h ip-of-mosquitto-server -u username -P password -t 'SmartEVSE-xxxxx/Set/EVMeter' -m L1:L2:L3:P:E
```
...where L1 - L3 are the currents in deci-Ampères. So 100 means 10.0A.
...where P is the Power in W,
...where E is the Energy in Wh.

You can find test scripts in the [test directory](https://github.com/SmartEVSE/SmartEVSE-3/tree/master/SmartEVSE-3/test) that feed EV and MainsMeter data to your MQTT server.

# Multiple SmartEVSE controllers on one mains supply (Power Share)
Up to eight SmartEVSE modules can share one mains supply.
  - Hardware connections
    - Connect the A, B and GND connections from the Master to the Node(s).
    - So A connects to A, B goes to B etc.
    - If you are using Smart/Solar mode, you should connect the A, B , +12V and GND wires from the sensorbox to the same screw terminals of the SmartEVSE! Make sure that the +12V wire from the sensorbox is connected to only -one– SmartEVSE.

  - Software configuration
    - Set one SmartEVSE PWR SHARE setting to MASTER, and the others to NODE 1-7. Make sure there is only one Master, and the Node numbers are unique.
    - On the Master configure the following:
      - MODE	  Set this to Smart if a Sensorbox (or configured kWh meter) is used to measure the current draw on the mains supply.
      It will then dynamically vary the charge current for all connected EV’s.  If you are using a dedicated mains supply for the EV’s you can leave this set to Normal.
      - MAINS Set to the maximum current of the MAINS connection (per phase).
      If the sensorbox or other MainsMeter device measures a higher current than this value on one of the phases, it will immediately reduce the current to the EVSE’s
      - CIRCUIT Set this to the maximum current of the EVSE circuit (per phase).
      This will be split between the connected and charging EV’s.
      - MAX 		 Set the maximum charging current for the EV connected to -this- SmartEVSE (per phase).
      - MIN		 Set to the lowest allowable charging current for all connected EV’s.
    - On the Nodes configure the following:
      - MAX 		 Set the maximum charging current for the EV connected to -this- SmartEVSE (per phase).

# Home Battery Integration
In a normal EVSE setup, a sensorbox is used to read the P1 information to deduce if there is sufficient solar energy available. This however can give unwanted results when also using a home battery as this will result in one battery charging the other one.

For this purpose the settings endpoint allows you to pass through the battery current information:
* A positive current means the battery is charging
* A negative current means the battery is discharging

The EVSE will use the battery current to neutralize the impact of a home battery on the P1 information.

**Regular updates from the consumer are required to keep this working as values cannot be older than 11 seconds.**

### Example
* Home battery is charging at 2300W -> 10A
* P1 has an export value of 230W -> -1A
* EVSE will neutralize the battery and P1 will be "exporting" -11A

The sender has several options when sending the home battery current:
* Send the current AS-IS -> EVSE current will be maximized
* Only send when battery is discharging -> AS-IS operation but EVSE will not discharge the home battery
* Reserve an amount of current for the home battery (e.g. 10A) -> Prioritize the home battery up to a specific limit

# Integration with Home Assistant
There are three options to integrate SmartEVSE with Home Assistant:
* through the HA-integration - the easy way

    If you want to integrate your SmartEVSE with Home Assistant, please have a look at [the SmartEVSE `custom_component` for Home Assistant](https://github.com/dingo35/ha-SmartEVSEv3). This `custom_component` uses the API to share data from the SmartEVSE to Home Assistant, and enables you to set SmartEVSE settings from Home Assistant. You will need firmware version 1.5.2 or higher to use this integration.

* by manually configuring your configuration.yaml

    It's a lot of work, but you can have everything exactly your way. See examples in the integrations directory of our GitHub repository.

* by MQTT

    If you don't like the integration, e.g. because it only updates its data every 60 seconds, you might like to interface through MQTT; updates are done as soon as values change.... you can even mix it up by using both the integration AND the MQTT interface at the same time!

# EU Capacity Rate Limiting

In line with a EU directive, electricity providers can implement a "capacity rate" for consumers, encouraging more balanced energy consumption. This approach aims to smooth out usage patterns and reduce peak demand.

For further details, please refer to [serkri#215](https://github.com/serkri/SmartEVSE-3/issues/215).



* The menu item "Capacity" can be set from 10-600A. (sum of all phases)
* This setting applies only in Smart or Solar mode.
* Beyond existing limits (Mains, MaxCircuit), the charging current will be controlled to ensure that the total of all Mains phase currents does not exceed the Capacity setting.
* If you are unfamiliar with this setting or do not fall under the applicable regulations, it is advisable to keep the setting at its default setting. (disabled)
