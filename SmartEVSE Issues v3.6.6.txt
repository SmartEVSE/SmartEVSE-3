20230802: output of HTTP POST set currents returns incorrect json:

> curl -X POST "http://smartevse-7033/currents?L1=101&L2=51&L3=-33" -d ''
< {"original":{"L":101,"":51,"SMART":-33},"L":101,"":51,"SMART":-33,"TOTAL":119}

- string texts wrong
- org values wrong
- target values good

- REST API calls return JSON content. This is undocumented in API.

                    DynamicJsonDocument doc(200);
                    for (int x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
                        doc["original"]["L" + x] = IrmsOriginal[x];
                        doc["L" + x] = Irms[x];
                    }
                    doc["TOTAL"] = Isum;

the "L"+x is an increment on const char *, not a String with a number appended
This happens one more time.

+warning uninitialized variable
src/evse.cpp: In function 'void CalcBalancedCurrent(char)':
src/evse.cpp:1219:44: warning: 'IsumImport' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

+ hangups too often!
+ pressing the charge on/off buttons on faceplate refresh display in fast succession, where its impossible to see what action is taken.
+ Normal mode somehow limited to 6A, while everything says 16A
+ Uninitialized var in CalcBalancedCurrent();
  change 	signed int IsumImport;
  to    	int IsumImport = 0;
+ Contactor 2 (with its mode = Auto) when switched off in solar charge mode is never switched on, though SW thinks it is. Also other charge modes (with 3-phase charging) leave contactor 2 off, resulting effectively in 1F charge, while SW thinks it is doing 3F charge. Changing to different charge mode (Normal or Smart) keeps charging at 1F. Only a power-cycle fixes this!
